        <h2>The power of music</h2>
        <p>
          We can all think of at least one song that, when we hear it, triggers
          an emotional response. It might be a song that accompanied the first
          dance at your wedding, for example, or a song that reminds you of a
          difficult break-up or the loss of a loved one.
